# Carbon Tracker Dashboard

A React-based eco-friendly activity tracker built with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. This app allows users to log daily activities, set carbon footprint goals, and view a dashboard with carbon usage summaries, charts, and sustainability resources.

## Features

- **Activity Logging:**  
  Log daily activities with details such as activity name, type, date, and associated carbon footprint.

- **Goal Settings:**  
  Set weekly and monthly carbon goals and compare them with your actual carbon usage.

- **Dashboard:**  
  View summary metrics (total carbon footprint, monthly usage, top carbon activity), goal comparisons, and interactive line charts showing weekly and monthly trends.

- **Resource Library:**  
  Access a curated list of sustainability resources, including guides on energy efficiency, sustainable transportation, waste reduction, and more.

- **Local Storage Persistence:**  
  All activities and goal settings are stored locally so your data persists across sessions.
